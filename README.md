# TetrisLikeGame-Java
 Tetris like game written in Java. I made this in high school.

##Caution
This program should be adjusted in the future.
There may be some bugs in it.
I will fix its code someday.

##Usage
Download 'resources' folder, and click Tetris.jar(You need Java-installed PC).
There's no sound in this application. To enjoy it with sound, replace WAV files in /resources/sound/.
Make sure the filename is the same as a file previously in it.
